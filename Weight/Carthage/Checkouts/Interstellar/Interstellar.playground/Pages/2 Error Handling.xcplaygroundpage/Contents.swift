//: [Previous](@previous)
//: ## Error Handling
//: Sometimes a function might return later with either a successfull value or some error. This is generally encoded in the `Result` type.
import Foundation

let successfullValue = Result(success: "Hello World")
let ohThereWasAnError = Result<String>(error: NSError(domain: "Something went wrong", code: 500, userInfo: nil))
//: An `Observable` can contain results just as normal values:
let resultOfExpensiveCalculation: Observable<Result<String>> = Observable(successfullValue)
//: You can subscribe to it just like to a normal `Observable`:
resultOfExpensiveCalculation.subscribe { result in
    switch result {
    case let .error(error): print(error)
    case let .success(value): print(value)
    }
}
//: In case you want to chain multiple transforms but only want to continue on the successful path, there's the `then` method:
func uppercase(input: String) -> String {
    return input.uppercased()
}

let transformed: Observable<Result<String>> = resultOfExpensiveCalculation.then(uppercase)
//: This even works for throwing functions. In case of an error the error is returned:
func throwingUppercase(input: String) throws -> String {
    return input.uppercased()
}

let transformedAgain = transformed.then(throwingUppercase)
//: This way you can build a chain of transformations. As soon as any of those transforms returns an error, all further steps are skipped and the subscribe callback will be called with an error.
//: If you're only interested in a successful chain you can directly subscribe to succesful values:
transformedAgain.next { myMessage in
    print(myMessage)
}
//: Or just subscribe to the failing case:
transformedAgain.error { error in
    error
}
